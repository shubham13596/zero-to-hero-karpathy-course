Implementation of Karpathy's course Neural Networks: Zero to Hero

This repo contains the code as part of Andrej Karpathy's Youtube course, [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ). Since this was a Youtube course, I was initially very skeptical of learning via this course. However, as I got into it, I couldn't help but be drawn to Karpathy's wonderful teaching style. Each topic builds upon the other without the learner feeling overwhelmed.
The course follows Stanford's flagship NLP course: CS224n in many ways.

For anyone taking this course, would recommend to code along and then try by yourself each lecture. Definitely go through the research papers he recommends in each of his videos. Helps bring intuition as to why we are doing what we are doing.
